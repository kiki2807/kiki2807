Hi! I'm Cristina, a data scientist with a background in wine & spirits, passionate about solving business challenges through data. I’ve completed over 13 technical projects in business analytics, machine learning, and data visualization using Python, SQL, and Excel.

Before transitioning into tech, I spent over six years in the wine industry, working with top brands such as Casa Cuervo and Zamora Company. I specialized in brand strategy, client relations, and product education—always with a data-informed approach. This business-first mindset is what drives my data work today.

In 2024, I enrolled in the TripleTen Data Science Program, where I’ve developed and applied skills in:
- 🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy, BeautifulSoup)
- 🧠 Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, LightGBM)
- 📊 Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- 🧮 SQL & statistical analysis

During the program, I collaborated with peers on end-to-end data science projects involving customer churn, car price prediction, taxi demand forecasting, and more. I’m now focused on applying these skills to roles where I can help businesses grow through insight and storytelling.

👩‍💻 A few facts about me:
- 🍷 I hold an **MBA in Wine & Spirits Management** and a **WSET Level 3 certification** (Distinction).
- 🛠 I enjoy turning messy data into actionable stories that business leaders can use.
- 👩‍🍳 I’m passionate about good food, wine pairings, and creative problem-solving.
- 📈 My dream is to work at the intersection of **data, hospitality, and consumer behavior**.
